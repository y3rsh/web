### I really hate the identity politics in the United States right now.  How about I just be Josh and you be you and we get to know each other.  Some things about me:

- Everything by [Peter F Hamilton](http://amzn.to/2j8iYCg) is spectacular.
- Podcasts and Audible make me a better more thoughtful person.
- [Trail Hawks are awesome.](https://trailhawks.com) - Kindness to Life and Land!
