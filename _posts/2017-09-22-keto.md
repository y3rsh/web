Once time I lost 100 pounds on Keto.  I felt great.  148 days straight of Keto.

What is Keto you say? [reddit.com/r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell)

I am beginning again.  I have tried to start again many times.  I have never lasted more than a week or two.

This time I feel different.  My mindfulness practice is maturing with the help of my therapist.  When I think about eating I am body scanning and using lists of feeling words to describe my state.  I think about eating a lot.  Hoping the keto habits will help that, it certainly did before.
