<h3>What people say about me</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Josh is a truly brilliant and innovative engineer.  With every project he improves our processes and automation. He has taken ownership of tough issues facing Rackspace as a whole by developing tools used by a wide variety of teams to solve tough issues...."</p>
<p>"Josh is more than a highly talented senior SDeT in our QE organization, he is an example to others in many ways.  His positive attitude, high level of engagement, outstanding leadership, high quality skill sets in every aspect of his work, not only puts him as a strong SDT in our organization but also as a shining example to others of a Racker who is a natural leader who holds himself to high standards.  Josh not only owns his product but engages with developers, operations, other leaders such as dev managers, to propose solutions to improve the product and the team as a whole."</p>
<p>"Josh is naturally a very engaged and positive Racker.  Heâ€™s always looking on the bright side of things and problems donâ€™t seem to get to him as much as it would to others.  Any meeting that Josh is part of, he contributes, shares his ideas and always in such a positive and professional manner.  His positivism usually influences the mood in a team meeting and positive conversations are able to be had because of it."</p>
